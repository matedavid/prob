## Use:
`insert use`

## Intentions with this project: 
My goal when I was creating this project was not to 'reinvent the wheel' by sort of copying git. From the beginning it was focused on learning and improving my skills as a programmer, and if the project turned out to be good, used myself for some projects. And for the time being, it is fulfilling that objective.
