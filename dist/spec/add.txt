Use: prob add <file>

Consideration:
    - You can also pass in '.' as file to add all files in the current directory
    - If you want to save a file inside of a folder, add the full path ex. directory/file, of use '.' to add all files.
    - You can create a file named .probignore in the program directory, and add in there the name of the files you dont want to be added
